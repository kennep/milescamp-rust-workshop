# Rust Workshop @ Miles Oslo Local Camp 2021

Thank you for joining the workshop!‚ù§ When we meet you need to bring your own laptop
with the Rust toolchain already installed. Windows, macOS or Linux will all work fine
for this.

## Installing Rust

The recommended way of getting Rust on your computer is to install via
[RustUp](https://rustup.rs/), the Rust toolchain installer.

On Windows, you install by downloading a small EXE file from the RustUp site,
while on the other platforms you download and run a shell script using a shell
one-liner. There are also other ways of installing.

Please install Rustup by following the instructions on the site.

When you've got Rust installed, the following commands should work:
```
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.54.0 (5ae8d74b3 2021-06-22)
```

Now that you've got Rust and Cargo installed, you need an IDE. I'm using
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the 
[Rust](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust)
plugin, but both 
[Emacs](https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-07_rust-with-emacs/) and
[Vim](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim) offer Rust support.
There's even an [IntelliJ plugin](https://intellij-rust.github.io/)!

## Taking Rust for a spin

To get to know your chosen IDE and the Rust language a little before the
workshop, I recommend you read through
[Chapter 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)
of the [Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) book,
and try to compile and run the "Hello, World" example there.

Feel free to browse thrugh the rest of the chapters as well!.

## Think about your next Rust project

The workshop will last approximately 3 hours, of which approx. 1 hour will be spent
on introductory material, setting up the groups and getting started, and then we
will spend 2 hours on a mini-Hackaton where we try to make something useful or cool
with Rust. To get us kickstarted, spend a little time before we meet to think about
what _you_ would like to make! :)
